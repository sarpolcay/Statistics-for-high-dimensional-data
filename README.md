# Statistics-for-high-dimensional-data
Statistics for high dimensional and complex data(Statistik hochdimensionaler und komplexer Daten)

This was a university project from the Winter Semester 2021, where I demonstrated some data manipulation techniques, ML algorithms such as LASSO, RIDGE, Elastic Net, GBM. I evaluated the built models accordingly to the instructions of the course instructor using Mallows-Cp, R squared. Some models were built using cross-validation and train-test splitting methodology. The original version of the project was in german.

The projects were based on the data sets below;

Seattle Housing Data

Insurance Claims Data

The third(or the first data set in the project) "Vertragsdaten.csv" can not be found online. I uploaded the data to the repository.
